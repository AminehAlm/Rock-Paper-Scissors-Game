🧠 How It Works
	•	Players choose between:
	•	1️⃣ Paper
	•	2️⃣ Scissors
	•	3️⃣ Rock
	•	4️⃣ Quit
	•	Winning logic is handled via:

self.winnerchoices = [(1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 2)]

Each tuple represents a winning (winner, loser) pair.

	•	Scores are added automatically and shown at the end of the match.
